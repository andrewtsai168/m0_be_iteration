# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
7/10
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? Iteration was a productive struggle, but doing the Spicy challenge at the end of Conditionals lesson was a very unproductive struggle
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I need more practice with a partner to who can navigator well.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? So many terminology to know in such a short time.
